# CS2: Zoning Toolkit

Mod for Cities Skylines 2 that provides control of the zoning along a city's roads. Zoning can be enabled on both sides of roads, on any one side, or no sides at all.
This enables finer control of where buildings will spawn, as well as placing roads close together without overlapping/conflicting zones.

## Potential Improvements
- Zoning tool remains active when you switch to a prefab that doesn't support zoning (ie. roundabouts, advanced road services), but should be turned off when switching prefabs.
- Zoning tool UI shows up in photo mode, but should not.
