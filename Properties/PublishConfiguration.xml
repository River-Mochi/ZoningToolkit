	<LongDescription>
This tool provides control of the zoning along a city's roads. Zoning can be enabled on both sides of roads, on any one side, or no sides at all.
This enables finer control of where buildings will spawn, as well as placing roads close together without overlapping/conflicting zones.

## Usage

The tool can be used both for placing new roads and updating existing roads.

### New roads
* Open the zoning options by clicking on the zoning button (top-left)
* Select desired zoning option (default, left, right, none)
* Draw new road with desired zoning applied (zoning side depends on the direction the road is drawn)

### Existing roads:     
* Open the zoning options by clicking on the zoning button (top-left)
* Select desired zoning option (default, left, right, none)
* Select the "update zoning" button in the zoning options panel (select again to turn off)
* Click on roads to update their zoning (supports click-and-drag for updating multiple roads)

## Notes

Please note that if you have buildings on a road, the zoning will not be toggled when updating zoning!
This is to prevent the buildings from being despawned when the zoning is removed.
