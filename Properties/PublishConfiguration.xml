	<LongDescription>### Zone Tools Redux

Change zoning along either new roads or update existing roads. Enable zoning on both sides of roads, left or right only, or no sides at all. 
This allows finer control of where buildings will spawn, as well as placing roads close together without overlapping/conflicting zones.

### New roads

- Open zone panel by clicking on the button (top-left) or hotkey (default shift+Z)
- Pre-select both, left, right, none.
- Draw a new road (note: side depends on road draw direction).

### Update Existing Roads (UER):

- Open the zoning panel (top-left button or hotkey)
- Enable the "Update" button, (recycle icon). Click again to turn off.
- Select the side of the road you want (both, left, right, none buttons)
- Click on roads to update their zoning (supports click-and-drag for updating many roads)
- Left mouse applies the zone change. Select different icons to change.
- New: right mouse click will also cycle the 4-zone options.

Power Trick: if you have existing roads and do not want a new road intersecting it to alter zoning, pick "none" then draw the new road. 
Your existing road should keep zoning facing the same original direction you set.

## Options

- ✅ Auto-open Zone Tools when road tools opens.
- ✅ Protect occupied cells (buildings) 
- ✅ Protect zoned-but-empty cells
