	<LongDescription>### Zone Tools Redux

Control of the zoning along any zonable road. Zoning can be enabled on both sides of roads, on left or right only, or no sides at all.
This enables finer control of where buildings will spawn, as well as placing roads close together without overlapping/conflicting zones.

## Usage

The tool can be used both for placing new roads and updating existing roads.

### New roads
* Open zoning panel by clicking on the button (top-left) or hotkey (default shift+Z)
* Select default (both), left, right, none.
* Draw a new road with (note: zoning side depends on the direction the road is drawn)

### Update Existing Roads (UER):     
* Open the same zoning panel (top-left button or hotkey)
* Enable the "update" button, recycle icon (select again to turn off)
* Select the side of the road you want (default, left, right, none)
* Click on roads to update their zoning (supports click-and-drag for updating multiple roads)
* Left Mouse applies the zoning change. New: right mouse Cycles through the 4 zone choices so you do not need to click icon again
* You can change the side you want by clicking the icon or use Right mouse click to cycle.

## Notes

Please note that if you have buildings on a road, for safety, the zoning will skip them so they are not destroyed!
This is to prevent the buildings from being despawned when the zoning is removed.
